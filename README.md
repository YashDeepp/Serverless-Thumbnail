# Serverless-Thumbnail
Set up an AWS serverless architecture to generate thumbnails for S3-uploaded images. Begin with S3 bucket creation for original and thumbnail images, along with a DynamoDB table for metadata. Define IAM roles for Lambda's S3, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch access. Code a Lambda function (Node.js or Python) to trigger on S3 uploads, creating thumbnails with libraries like Sharp or Pillow. Store the thumbnails in a designated S3 bucket and record metadata in DynamoDB. Construct an API Gateway to expose the functionality via a RESTful API, connecting it to the Lambda function. Configure environment variables for Lambda and enable monitoring through CloudWatch. Deploy using Serverless Framework or AWS SAM, and test the system by uploading an image through the API. Implement error handling, security measures, and consider scalability and cost optimization. Refer to AWS documentation for detailed instructions and best practices.
